Institute of Physical Chemistry PAS would like to offer you free samples of SERS substrates.

Dear {},
While working on development of our SERS substrates we came across your valued publication: "{}" which has aroused our great interest.
Based on your research topics, we consider that you may be interested in our SERS products: Silver and Silver â€“ Gold Hybrid Substrates of unusually high repeatability, stability and enhancement factor. Therefore, our company (http://sersitive.eu/) would like to offer you (and your coworkers) free samples of SERS substrates. If you wish to receive a free trial, please send us your shipping address so we could make a delivery free of charge.
We hope that our SERS substrates will meet your expectations.

Best regards,
